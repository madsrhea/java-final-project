# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

Between my two classes, I believe my understanding of Github, the terminal, and how to use markdown language to speed up the formatting process. I've even added the `status`, `add`, `commit`, and `push` commands onto my background to really nail it home. Even though I am new to all three, I already can see how they will be invaluable as I continue through my classes and personal projects.
