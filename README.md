# Final Project

This is the final project for my CIS-171 Java course at Kirkwood Community College. Below is a journal of all the things I learned throughout the class.

## Introduction

Between my two classes, I believe my understanding of Github, the terminal, and how to use markdown language to speed up the formatting process has been cemented. I've even added the `status`, `add`, `commit`, and `push` commands onto my background to really nail it home. Even though I am new to all three, I already can see how they will be invaluable as I continue through my classes and personal projects.

## Chapter 1

As we build up our program, in seperated parts unlike my *.NET* class, I'm excited to learn more in depth about how the different parts interact and how I can interact with them.  Though, something I definitely need to work on is remembering the different prompts to print in the different languages. While Java's `System.out.println()` seems to be the easiest of the bunch for me to remember, I still found myself typing in *Javascript*'s `Console.log()`, *C#*'s `Console.WriteLine()`, and even *Python*'s `print()` often enough that it was an issue.
